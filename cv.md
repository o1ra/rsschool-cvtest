## About me
>  I am currently a qa-engineer in a travel services company.
   I participate in functional, integration, regression testing, create test cases in testRail, and document the defects found in Jira.
   I have to work closely with the development department, and I really like it!
Therefore, in my free time, I spend on studying Front-end development
I believe that work should bring tangible benefits, something that can be seen. I spend a lot of time on the Internet, and I am inspired to create here
